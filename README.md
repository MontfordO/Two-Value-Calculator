# Two-Value-Calculator
This is a simple program that will make calculations (+,-,/,*) on two values. It will also store the calculations alongside the results in a .txt file specified by the user, which can be printed within the program.
 My main objective with this project was to make a program that is ideally able to handle most, if not all, input errors and other exceptions in the code. This stands for the file selection, value input and .txt file print.
